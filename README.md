This is an implementation of Mr.Kuleshov's et al paper for audio super resolution using Neural Networks and especially a deep learning technology - architecture with the name of Convolutional Autoencoder.

It is based on an Autoencoder where each block is a convolutional block.

The deliverables of this project will be:

1) A 4x hard coded network that will be ready to train
2) A code to get the right preprocessing for 2x,4x,6x cases.

If you find this helpful for a project, don't hesitate to contact me for further explanations.

It would be very pleasing to gather up information about the training time of the network in different setups, as well as your abillity to reproduce the end results.

Take care,
Jx
