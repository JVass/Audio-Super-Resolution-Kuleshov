This is an implementation of Mr.Kuleshov's et al paper for audio super resolution using Neural Networks and especially a deep learning technology - architecture with the name of UNet.

Architecture.py provides a parametrized function to create the Unet with respect to the length of down/up-sampling blocks and length of audio signals (ndim).

It would be very pleasing to gather up information about the training time of the network in different setups, as well as your abillity to reproduce the end results.

Take care,
